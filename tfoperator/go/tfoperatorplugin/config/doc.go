package config

// OPTIONAL
// Flyte uses https://github.com/lyft/flytestdlib/tree/master/config to manage configuration files
// Configs are useful for any common parameters that should be passed for every execution.
// It could also be used to configure rate limit or other client attributes like timeout etc specific to this plugin.
// If this is not the case, just delete the config folder
// Ofcourse configs are completely OPTIONAL!
